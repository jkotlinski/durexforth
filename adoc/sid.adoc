The `sid` module contains low-level words for controlling the SID chip. To load it, type `include sid`. To test that it works, run `sid-demo`.

=== Voice Control
((voice! _( n -- )_ :: Selects SID voice 0-2.
((freq! _( n -- )_ :: Writes 16-bit frequency.
((pulse! _( n -- )_ :: Writes 16-bit pulse value.
((control! _( n -- )_ :: Writes 8-bit control value.
((srad!)) _( srad -- )_ :: Writes 16-bit ADSR value. (Bytes are swapped.)
((note!)) _( n -- )_ :: Plays note in range [0, 94], where 0 equals C-0. The tuning is correct for PAL.

=== SID Control
((cutoff!)) _( n -- )_ :: Writes 16-bit filter cutoff value.
((filter!)) _( n -- )_ :: Writes 8-bit filter value.
((volume!)) _( n -- )_ :: Writes 8-bit volume.
