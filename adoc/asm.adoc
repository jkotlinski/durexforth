DurexForth features a simple but useful 6510 assembler with support for branches and labels. Assembly code is typically used within a `code` word, as in the tutorial example:

----
code flash
here        ( push current addr )
$d020 inc,  ( inc $d020 )
jmp,        ( jump to pushed addr )
;code
----

It is also possible to inline assembly code into a regular Forth word, as seen in the tutorial:

----
: flash begin [ $d020 inc, ] again ;
----

=== Variables

DurexForth has a few variables that are specifically meant to be used within code words.

((lsb)) _( -- addr )_ :: _addr_ points to the top of the LSB parameter stack. Together with the `x` register, it can be used to access stack contents.
((msb)) _( -- addr )_ :: _addr_ points to the top of the MSB parameter stack. Together with the `x` register, it can be used to access stack contents.
((w)) _( -- addr )_ :: A zero-page cell that code words may use freely as work area.
((w2)) _( -- addr )_ :: Second zero-page work area cell.
((w3)) _( -- addr )_ :: Third zero-page work area cell.

Example usage of `lsb` and `msb`:

----
code + ( n1 n2 -- sum )
clc,           ( clear carry )
lsb 1+ lda,x   ( load n1 lsb )
lsb adc,x      ( add n2 lsb )
lsb 1+ sta,x   ( store to n1 lsb )
msb 1+ lda,x   ( load n1 msb )
msb adc,x      ( add n2 msb )
msb 1+ sta,x   ( store to n2 msb )
inx,           ( drop n2; n1 = sum )
;code

=== Branches

The assembler supports forward and backward branches. These branches cannot overlap each other, so their usage is limited to simple cases.

((+branch)) _( -- addr )_ :: Forward branch.
((:+)) _( addr -- )_ :: Forward branch target.
((:-)) _( -- addr )_ :: Backward branch target.
((-branch)) _( addr -- )_ :: Backward branch.

Example of a forward branch:

----
foo lda,
+branch beq,
bar inc, :+
----

Example of a backward branch:

----
:- $d014 lda, f4 cmp,#
-branch bne,
----

=== Labels

The `labels` module adds support for more complicated flows where branches can overlap freely. These branches are resolved by the `;code` word, so it is not possible to branch past it.

((@:)) _( n -- )_ :: Create the assembly label _n_, where _n_ is a number in range [0, 255].
((@@)) _( n -- )_ :: Compile a branch to the label _n_.

Example:

----
code checkers
$7f lda,# 0 ldy,# 'l' @:
$400 sta,y $500 sta,y
$600 sta,y $700 sta,y
dey, 'l' @@ bne, ;code
