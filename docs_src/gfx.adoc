=== Turtle Graphics

Turtle graphics are mostly known from LOGO, a 1970s programming language.
It enables control of a turtle that can move and turn while holding a pen.
The turtle graphics library is loaded with `include turtle`.

((init)) _( -- )_ :: Initialize turtle graphics.
((forward)) _( px -- )_ :: Move the turtle `px` pixels forward.
((back)) _( px -- )_ :: Move the turtle `px` pixels back.
((left)) _( deg -- )_ :: Rotate the turtle `deg` degrees left.
((right)) _( deg -- )_ :: Rotate the turtle `deg` degrees right.
((penup)) _( -- )_ :: Pen up (disables drawing).
((pendown)) _( -- )_ :: Pen down (enables drawing).
((turtle@)) _( -- state )_ :: Remember turtle state.
((turtle!)) _( state -- )_ :: Restore turtle state as earlier read by `turtle@`.
((moveto)) _( x y deg -- )_ :: Move turtle to _x y_ with angle _deg_.

=== High-Resolution Graphics

The high-resolution graphics library is loaded with `include gfx`.
It is inspired by "Step-by-Step Programming Commodore 64: Graphics Book 3."
Some demonstrations can be found in `gfxdemo`.

((hires)) _( -- )_ :: Enter the high-resolution drawing mode.
((lores)) _( -- )_ :: Switch back to low-resolution text mode.
((clrcol)) _( colors -- )_ :: Clear the high-resolution display using _colors_.
_Colors_ is a byte value with foreground color in high nibble, background color in low nibble.
E.g. `15 clrcol` clears the screen with green background, white foreground.
((blkcol)) _( col row colors -- )_ :: Change colors of the 8x8 block at given position.
((plot)) _( x y -- )_ :: Set the pixel at _x_, _y_.
((peek)) _( x y -- p )_ :: Get the pixel at _x_, _y_.
((line)) _( x y -- )_ :: Draw a line to _x_, _y_.
((circle)) _( x y r -- )_ :: Draw a circle with radius _r_ around _x_, _y_.
((erase)) _( mode -- )_ :: Change blit method for line drawing.
`1 erase` uses `xor` for line drawing, `0 erase` switches back to `or`.
((paint)) _( x y -- )_ :: Paint the area at _x_, _y_.
((text)) _( column row str strlen -- )_ :: Draw a text string at the given position.
E.g. `10 8 parse-name hallo text` draws the message `hallo` at column 16, row 8.
((drawchar)) _( column row addr -- )_ :: Draw a custom character at given column and row, using the 8 bytes long data starting at addr.
