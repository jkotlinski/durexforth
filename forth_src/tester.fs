\ 24/11/2015 Replaced Core Ext word <> with = 0=
\ 31/3/2015 Variable #ERRORS added and incremented for each error reported.
\ 22/1/09 The words { and } have been changed to T{ and }T respectively to
\ agree with the Forth 200X file ttester.fs. This avoids clashes with
\ locals using { ... } and the FSL use of }
