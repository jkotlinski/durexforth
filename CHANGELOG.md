## [Unreleased]

### Changed
 - LS abort on LOADB error, PAGE upon success.
 - RDIR improve placement of MORE.
 - LS now accepts wildcards, drive #'s or not.
 - Dictionary restructured, now header and code data are split.
 - Header data is not a linked list, and grows downward from $9fff. Record structure: `len_flags | str | xt`
 - Prompt displays `ful` when there is less than 256 bytes of dictionary space left.
 - FIND-NAME now returns a name token per the standard proposal
 - V internal words hidden, BUFSTART no longer variable, fixed at $7000.
 - LATEST changed from VARIABLE to VALUE
### Added
 - RDIR will display directory formatted data anywhere in memory.
 - PAD Scratch pad memory set to cassette buffer. Untouched by DurexForth
 - DOWORDS, which allows executing an xt for every word in the wordlist 
 - Turn-key operation utilities in TURNKEY:
 - SAVE-PACK packs the dictionary together before saving, which unpacks at runtime.
 - SAVE-PRG removes the dictionary and saves the program
 - TOP returns the address of the last byte of the header structure. The value at this address will always be 0.
 - TOP! can be used to specify the position of header data.
 - HIDE removes a word from the word list, while leaving its definition in place.
 - DEFINE assigns HERE to a word in the word list and begins compilation.
 - DEFCODE does the same as DEFINE, but begins a CODE: segment instead.
 - V commands: A, R, +, -, HOME, e, C, D, s, S, H, L, M, ^w, f, F
### Fixed
 - V did not compile in DECIMAL mode.
 - V long line

 - VICE label dumper. 'include viceutil' and DUMP-LABELS
   to generate a label file for VICE debugging.
 - V: * and n commands
### Fixed
 - Evaluating an INCLUDE would corrupt the evaluated string.
   Broke in 1.6.7.
 - Code stripping tutorial did not work.
 - WORD did not work while interpreting.
 - REQUIRED marked a file as included even if it was not found.
 - MARKER did not reset REQUIRED state.
