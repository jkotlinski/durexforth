\chapter{Editor} \label{editor}

The editor is a vi clone. Launch it by entering \texttt{v foo} in the interpreter (\texttt{foo} being the file you want to edit). You may also enter \texttt{v} without argument to create an unnamed buffer. For more info about vi style editing, see \href{http://www.vim.org}{the Vim web site}.

The position of the editor buffer is \$7000.
