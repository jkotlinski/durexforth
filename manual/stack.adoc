Stack overflow and underflow are common causes for errors and crashes.
Simply put, the data stack must not contain too many or too few items.
This section describes some techniques to avoid such errors.

One helpful technique to avoid stack crashes is to add comments about stack usage.
In this example, we imagine a graphics word "drawbox" that draws a black box.
+( color -- )+ indicates that it takes one argument on stack, and on exit it should
leave nothing on the stack.
The comments inside the word (starting with £) indicate what the stack
looks like after the line has executed.

----
: drawbox ( color -- )
10 begin dup 20 < while £ color x
10 begin dup 20 < while £ color x y
2dup £ color x y x y
4 pick £ color x y x y color
blkcol £ color x y
1+ repeat drop £ color x
1+ repeat 2drop ;
----

Once the word is working as supposed, it may be nice to again remove the comments, as
they are no longer very interesting to read.

NOTE: The Forth standard defines backslash (\) as the line comment character, but the C64 lacks a real backslash.
Moreover, ASCII \ and PETSCII £ both map to $5c.
Therefore, the £ character is used as a substitution on the C64.

Another useful technique during development is to check at the end of your main loop
that the stack depth is what you expect it to. This will catch stack underflows
and overflows.

----
: mainloop begin
( do stuff here... )
depth abort" depth not 0"
again ;
