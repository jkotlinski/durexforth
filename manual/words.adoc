The invoked _xt_ has the stack effect _( k * x nt -- l * x flag )_. If _flag_ is true, `dowords` will continue on to the next name, otherwise it will return.

=== Variables

==== Variables

Variables are faster to write to than values.

((variable)) _bar_:: Define variable _bar_.
_bar_ ((@)):: Fetch value of variable _bar_.
_1 bar_ ((!)):: Set variable _bar_ to _1_.

=== Control Flow

((if)) ... ((then)) :: condition IF true-part THEN rest

----
( prints odd numbers from 1 to n )
: printoddnumbers (n -- ) 1 do i . 2 +loop ;

((key?)) _( -- flag )_ :: Return true if a character is available for `key`.

((char)) _( -- c )_ :: Parse the next word, delimited by a space, and puts its first character on the stack.
((>in)) _( -- addr )_ :: Give the address of a cell containing the offset in characters from the start of the input buffer to the start of the parse area.

((pad)) _( -- addr )_ :: _addr_ is the address of the `pad`, a 161-byte memory region that can be used freely by user words.
No built-in words will modify this region.

=== Disk I/O

((include)) _( "filename" -- )_ :: Load and parse file. Example: `include test`
((included)) _( filenameptr filenamelen -- )_ :: Load and parse file.
((require)) _( "filename" -- )_ :: Like include, except that load is skipped if the file is already loaded.
((required)) _( filenameptr filenamelen -- )_ :: Like included, except that load is skipped if the file is already loaded.

((device)) _( device# -- )_ :: Switch the current device.

((rdir)) _( addr -- )_ :: Display disk directory previously loaded to addr.
((rderr)) _( -- )_ :: Read and print error channel of the current device.

==== DOS Commands

Words for sending DOS commands to drives and reading drive status are available by including the `dos` module.

((send-cmd)) _( c-addr u -- )_ :: Write the given string to secondary address 15 on the current device, and print the drive's response. The following example defines a word, `backup` that creates a copy of `durexforth` called `backup`:
----
: backup s" copy0:backup=durexforth" send-cmd ;
backup
----

((dos)) _( "cmd" -- )_ :: Send _cmd_ to the current device's command channel, and print the response. Note that the remainder of the line is treated as part of the command. This makes it possible to refer to file names that contain spaces, but means that `dos` and its command should be on their own line, or the last words on a line. Example: `dos scratch0:old file` will delete a file named _old file_.

==== Low-Level Device I/O

For more advanced uses, words corresponding to the standard Commodore Kernal IO routines are available by including the `io` module.

((open)) _( filenameptr filenamelength file# secondary-addr -- ioresult )_ :: Open a logical file.
((chkin)) _( file# -- ioresult )_ :: Use a logical file as input device.
((chkout)) _( file# -- ioresult )_ :: Use a logical file as output device.
((clrchn)) _( -- )_ :: Reset input and output to the keyboard and screen.
((close)) _( file# -- )_ :: Close a logical file.
((readst)) _( -- status )_ :: Return the status of the last IO operation.
For serial-bus devices, `$01` = write timeout, `$02` = read timeout, `$40` = end of file (EOI), `$80` = device not present.
((chrin)) _( -- char)_ :: Read a character from the current input device.
((ioabort)) _( ioresult -- )_ Handle error conditions for `open`, `chkin` and `chkout`. On failure, print error message and abort.

As per the underlying Kernal routines, `chrin` does not check for end-of-file or any other error condition. `readst` should be called to ensure that the returned character is valid.

The _ioresult_ value returned by `open`, `chkin` and `chkout` is 0 on success, or a Kernal error number if an error occurred.

[CAUTION]
====
Low-level device I/O may interfere with disk accesses done by durexForth and the `v` editor. The following guidelines should be followed to avoid interference:

- Avoid using file numbers 15 and below (remember, any number up to 127 can be used as a file number).
- Only use input/output redirection (`chkin` and `chkout`) within word definitions, and ensure that `clrchn` is called before exit.
- Close files as soon as they are no longer needed.
- If multiple files are open, always call `clrchn` to end any serial bus transactions before calling `open` or switching between files with `chkin` or `chkout`.
====

==== Protocol-Level IEC Device I/O

For even more advanced uses, words corresponding to the standard Commodore IEC routines are available by including the `iec` module.
These words allow access to serial devices without accessing the file system, and won't hang the computer on a "Device not present" error.


((listen)) _( dv -- ioresult )_ :: Send IEC listen to dv.
((second)) _( command+sa -- ioresult )_ :: Send IEC command and secondary address after listen.
((unlisten)) _( -- )_ :: Send IEC unlisten to all channels.
((ciout)) _( -- u )_ ::  Puts a data byte onto the serial bus using full handshaking.
((talk)) _( dv -- ioresult )_ :: Send IEC talk to dv.
((tksa)) _( command+sa -- ioresult )_ :: Send IEC command and secondary address after talk.
((untalk)) _( -- )_ :: Send IEC untalk to all channels.
((acptr)) _( u -- )_ :: Get a byte of data from the serial bus using full handshaking.

[WARNING]
====
These commands should never be used by anyone. Ever.

Commands for ``second and tksa`` include:

- $60 OPEN CHANNEL / DATA + Secondary Address / channel (0-15)
- $E0 CLOSE + Secondary Address / channel (0-15)
- $F0 OPEN + Secondary Address / channel (0-15)
====

==== IEC examples

((send-cmd)) _( c-addr u -- )_ :: Same as Dos command.
((dos)) _( "cmd" -- )_ :: Same as Dos command.
((bsave)) _( start end+1 filenameptr filenamelength -- )_ :: Same as saveb.
((dir)) :: Same as ``ls``.

((aligned)) _( -- )_ :: No-op
((chars)) _( -- )_ :: No-op
((2@)) _( addr -- x1 x2 )_ :: Fetch 32-bit value from _addr_. _x2_ is stored at _addr_, and _x1_ is stored at _addr_ + 2.

((>number)) _( ud addr u -- ud addr2 u2 )_ :: Convert the string in _addr u_ to digits, using `base`, and adds each digit into _ud_ after multiplying it with `base`. _addr2 u2_ contains the part of the string that was not converted.
((>body)) _( xt -- addr )_ :: Return the data field address that belongs to the execution token. Example use: `' foo >body`
((sm/rem)) _( d n -- r q )_ :: Divide double-cell number _d_ by _n_, giving the symmetric quotient _q_ and the remainder _r_. Values are signed.
((true)) _( -- true )_ :: Return a _true_ flag, a single-cell value with all bits set.
((false)) _( -- false )_ :: Return a _false_ flag.

=== Kernel Calls

Safe kernel calls may be done from Forth words using ((sys)) _( addr -- )_. The helper variables ((ar)), ((xr)), ((yr)) and ((sr)) can be used to set arguments and get results through the a, x, y and status registers.

Example: `'0' ar c! $ffd2 sys` calls the CHROUT routine, which prints `0` on screen.

=== Turn-key Utilities

These words are available by including `turnkey`.

((top)) _( -- addr )_ :: Address of the top of the dictionary, default: $9fff.

((top!)) _( addr -- )_ :: Relocate the dictionary to _addr_. Example:

----
\ not using $a000 block, give all memory to dictionary
$cbff top!
----

((save-pack)) _( "filename" -- )_ :: Save a compact version of forth to the given _filename_.
((save-prg)) _( "filename" -- )_ :: Save a forth program with no dictionary to _filename_.

Further details on the use of these words are outlined in <<_turn_key_operation>>.
