\section{Inspecting a Word}

Let us define a word and see what it gets compiled to.

\begin{verbatim}
: bg d020 c! ;
\end{verbatim}

After the word is defined, you can get its start address by \texttt{latest @}, and the contents of bg can be dumped using \texttt{latest @ dump}. Try it, and you will get output like the following:

\begin{alltt}
4c38  ed 4b 02 42 47 20 cf 0e .k.bg ..
4c40  20 d0 4c 49 0a ff ff ff  .li....
4c48  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ........
4c50  ...
\end{alltt}

Here, we can see that the "bg" word is 14 bytes long and starts at address \$4c38. It contains two parts: Header and code.

\section{Header}

\begin{alltt}
4c38  \textcolor{red}{ed 4b 02 42 47} 20 cf 0e \textcolor{red}{.k.bg} ..
4c40  20 d0 4c 49 0a ff ff ff  .li....
\end{alltt}

The first two bytes contain a back-pointer to the previous word, starting at \$4bed. The next byte, "02", is the length of "bg" name string. After that, the string "bg" follows. (42 = 'b', 47 = 'g')

The name length byte is also used to store special attributes of the word. Bit 7 is "immediate" flag, which means that the word should execute immediately instead of being compiled into word definitions. ("(" is such an example of an immediate word that does not get compiled.) Bit 6 is "hidden" flag, which makes a word unfindable. Bit 5 is the "no-tail-call-elimination" flag, which makes sure that tail call elimination (the practice of replacing jsr/rts with jmp) is not performed if this word is the jsr target. Since bg does not have these flags set, bits 7-5 are all clear.

\section{Code}

\begin{alltt}
4c38  ed 4b 02 42 47 \textcolor{red}{20 cf 0e} .k.bg\textcolor{red}{ ..}
4c40  \textcolor{red}{20 d0 4c 49 0a ff ff ff  .li..}..
\end{alltt}

The code section contain pure 6502 machine code.

\begin{description}
\item[20 cf 0e ( jsr \$ecf )] \$ecf is the adress of the \texttt{lit} code. \texttt{lit} copies the two following bytes to parameter stack.
\item[20 d0 ( \$d020 )] The parameter to the \texttt{lit} word. When executed, \texttt{lit} will add \$d020 to the parameter stack.
\item[4c 49 0a ( jmp \$a49 )] \$a49 is the address of the \texttt{c!} code.
\end{description}
