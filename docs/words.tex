\end{description}

\section{Kernel Calls}

Safe kernel calls may be done from Forth words using \texttt{sys} ( addr -- ). The helper variables \texttt{ar}, \texttt{xr}, \texttt{yr} and \texttt{sr} can be used to set arguments and get results through the a, x, y and status registers.

Example: \texttt{'0' ar c! \$ffd2 sys} calls the CHROUT routine, which prints \texttt{0} on screen.
