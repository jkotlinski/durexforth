    Typical use: \texttt{: x ... test abort" error" ... ;}

\item[quit] Enters an endless loop where DurexForth interprets Forth commands from the keyboard. The word is named "quit" since it can be used to quit a program. It also does cleanup tasks like resetting input.

\end{description}

\section{Editing}

\begin{description}
\item[v filename]

Opens text editor and starts editing the file named "filename".
If filename is empty and a buffer is already open, editor will pick up where it left.

\section{Debugging}

\begin{description}
\item[words] List all defined words.
\item[size] \texttt{size foo} prints size of \texttt{foo}.
\item[dump ( n -- )] Memory dump starting at address n.
\item[n] Continue memory dump where last one stopped.
\item[see word] Decompile Forth word and print to screen. Try \texttt{see see}.
	Note: \texttt{see} will concatenate subsequent \texttt{noname:} definitions when displaying output. This is because \texttt{see} displays all code between the target word and the address of the next word located in the dictionary. Because \texttt{:noname} does not create a word header, it will not be present in the dictionary.
		Some modules hide internal words, and define their public words with \texttt{defer}. Using \texttt{see} on the very last of these deferred words in a module will display the code and data of all of the internal words. Calling \texttt{see v} for example will produce pages of output.
\end{description}

\section{System State}

\begin{description}


\item[latest (value)] Address of latest defined header.

\item[here (value)] Write position of the Forth compiler (usually first unused byte of code space). Many C64 assemblers refer to this as program counter or \texttt{*}.


\item[marker name ( -- )] Creates a word that when called, forgets itself and all words that were defined after it. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
marker forget
: x ;
forget
\end{verbatim}

\item[dowords ( xt -- )] Remove \texttt{xt} from the stack. Execute \texttt{xt} once for every word in the wordlist, passing the name token \texttt{nt} of the word to \texttt{xt}, until the wordlist is exhausted or until \texttt{xt} returns false. The invoked \texttt{xt} has the stack effect \texttt{( k * x nt -- l * x flag)}. If \texttt{flag} is true, \texttt{dowords} will continue on to the next name, otherwise it will return.

\begin{verbatim}
\ from debug.fs
: (words) more name>string space 1 ;
: words ['] (words) dowords ;
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

    \item[sm/rem ( d n -- r q )] Divide double-cell number d by n, giving the symmetric quotient q and the remainder r. Values are signed.

\end{description}

\section{Kernel Calls}

Safe kernel calls may be done from Forth words using \texttt{sys} ( addr -- ). The helper variables \texttt{ar}, \texttt{xr}, \texttt{yr} and \texttt{sr} can be used to set arguments and get results through the a, x, y and status registers.

Example: \texttt{'0' ar c! \$ffd2 sys} calls the CHROUT routine, which prints \texttt{0} on screen.

\section{Turn-key Utilities}
These words are available by including \texttt{turnkey}.
\begin{description}
\item[top ( -- addr )] Address of the top of the dictionary, default: \$9fff. 

\item[top! ( addr -- )] Relocates the dictionary to \texttt{addr}. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
\ not using $a000 block, give all memory to dictionary
$cbff top!
\end{verbatim}

\item[save-pack filename ( -- )] Saves a compact version of forth to the given filename.
\item[save-prg filename ( -- )] Saves a forth program with no dictionary to filename.
\end{description}

	Further details on use of these words outlined in the Turn-key Operation section of the tutorial.

\section{Platform Detection}

\texttt{include platform} will detect the type of system durexForth is currently running on, and create the constant \texttt{platform} with a corresponding value.

Currently-supported \texttt{platform} values are:

\begin{description}
\item[64] Commodore 64, SX-64, or Commodore 128 running in Commodore 64 mode.
\item[128] Commodore 128 running in native mode.
\end{description}
