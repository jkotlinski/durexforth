\begin{description}


\item[latest (value)] Address of latest defined header.

\item[here (value)] Write position of the Forth compiler (usually first unused byte of code space). Many C64 assemblers refer to this as program counter or \texttt{*}.

\item[pad ( -- addr )] Address of the \texttt{pad}, a 161-byte memory region that can be used freely by user words. No built-in words will modify this region.

\item[marker name ( -- )] Creates a word that when called, forgets itself and all words that were defined after it. Example:

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\item[dowords ( xt -- )] Remove \texttt{xt} from the stack. Execute \texttt{xt} once for every word in the wordlist, passing the name token \texttt{nt} of the word to \texttt{xt}, until the wordlist is exhausted or until \texttt{xt} returns false. The invoked \texttt{xt} has the stack effect \texttt{( k * x nt -- l * x flag)}. If \texttt{flag} is true, \texttt{dowords} will continue on to the next name, otherwise it will return.

\begin{verbatim}
\ from debug.fs
: (words) more name>string space 1 ;
: words ['] (words) dowords ;
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\section{Disk I/O}

\item[rdir ( addr -- )] Display disk directory previously loaded to addr.
\end{description}

\subsection{DOS Commands}

Words for sending DOS commands to drives and reading drive status are available by including \texttt{dos}.

\begin{description}
    \item[send-cmd ( addr length -- )] Writes the given string to secondary address 15 on the current device, and prints the drive's response. The following example defines a word, \texttt{backup} that creates a copy of \texttt{durexforth} called \texttt{backup}:
    \begin{verbatim}
        : backup s" copy0:backup=durexforth" send-cmd ;
        backup
    \end{verbatim}

    \item[dos command ( -- )] Sends \texttt{command} to the current device's command channel, and prints the response. Note that the remainder of the line is treated as part of the command. This makes it possible to refer to file names that contain spaces, but means that \texttt{dos} and its command should be on their own line, or the last words on a line. Example: \texttt{dos scratch0:old file} will delete a file named ``\texttt{old file}''.
\end{description}

\subsection{Low-Level Device I/O}

For more advanced uses, words corresponding to the standard Commodore Kernal IO routines are available by including \texttt{io}.

\begin{description}
    \item[open ( filenameptr filenamelength file\# secondary-addr -- ioresult )] Open a logical file.
    \item[chkin ( file\# -- ioresult )] Use a logical file as input device.
    \item[chkout ( file\# -- ioresult )] Use a logical file as output device.
    \item[clrchn ( -- )] Resets input and output to the keyboard and screen.
    \item[close ( file\# -- )] Close a logical file.
    \item[readst ( -- status )] Returns the status of the last IO operation. For serial-bus devices, \texttt{\$01} = write timeout, \texttt{\$02} = read timeout, \texttt{\$40} = end of file (EOI), \texttt{\$80} = device not present.
    \item[chrin ( -- char)] Reads a character from the current input device.
    \item[ioabort ( ioresult -- )] Handles error conditions for \texttt{open}, \texttt{chkin} and \texttt{chkout}. On failure, print error message and abort.
\end{description}

As per the underlying Kernal routines, \texttt{chrin} does not check for end-of-file or any other error condition. \texttt{readst} should be called to ensure that the returned character is valid.

The \texttt{ioresult} value returned by \texttt{open}, \texttt{chkin} and \texttt{chkout} is 0 on success, or a Kernal error number if an error occurred.

Note that use of low-level device I/O may interfere with disk accesses done by durexForth and the \texttt{V} editor. The following guidelines should be followed to avoid interference:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid using file numbers 15 and below (remember, any number up to 127 can be used as a file number).
    \item Only use input/output redirection (\texttt{chkin} and \texttt{chkout}) within word definitions, and ensure that \texttt{clrchn} is called before exit.
    \item Close files as soon as they are no longer needed.
    \item If multiple files are open, always call \texttt{clrchn} to end any serial bus transactions before calling \texttt{open} or switching between files with \texttt{chkin} or \texttt{chkout}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Compatibility}

The \texttt{compat} module contains various words that are not deemed necessary for enjoyable DurexForth operation, but still must be provided to comply with the Forth 2012 core standard.

    \item[$>$number ( ud addr u -- ud addr2 u2 )] Converts the string in \texttt{addr u} to digits, using \texttt{BASE}, and adds each digit into ud after multiplying it with \texttt{BASE}. \texttt{addr2 u2} contains the part of the string that was not converted.

    \item[sm/rem ( d n -- r q )] Divide double-cell number d by n, giving the symmetric quotient q and the remainder r. Values are signed.

\end{description}

\section{Kernel Calls}

Safe kernel calls may be done from Forth words using \texttt{sys} ( addr -- ). The helper variables \texttt{ar}, \texttt{xr}, \texttt{yr} and \texttt{sr} can be used to set arguments and get results through the a, x, y and status registers.

Example: \texttt{'0' ar c! \$ffd2 sys} calls the CHROUT routine, which prints \texttt{0} on screen.

\section{Turn-key Utilities}
These words are available by including \texttt{turnkey}.
\begin{description}
\item[top ( -- addr )] Address of the top of the dictionary, default: \$9fff.

\item[top! ( addr -- )] Relocates the dictionary to \texttt{addr}. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
\ not using $a000 block, give all memory to dictionary
$cbff top!
\end{verbatim}

\item[save-pack filename ( -- )] Saves a compact version of forth to the given filename.
\item[save-prg filename ( -- )] Saves a forth program with no dictionary to filename.
\end{description}
